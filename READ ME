In this assignment I except the first choice of dragons I think I have more callback in the further story like there is a phase that the game would keep letting users choose if they want to go out or train. If you press training it's going to enter a callback phrase asking if you want to train more or go out.  I add more callbacks when players are facing a tournament, three for each tournament, a total of three tournaments, so have 9 callbacks in the tournament phase and a few in the first chosen phase.
